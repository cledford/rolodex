# rolodex

·           Create a single-page CRUD application using C#, WebAPI (.Net Core 2.2), front end of your choice, with data being stored in a relational database.

·           The application would be used by approximately 20,000 users daily, and we expect each of those users to maintain ~1,000 contact records.

·           A user should be able to interact with a scrollable list of their business contacts, as well as adding, editing, and deleting their contacts.

·           Each business contact record contains basic information such as email, name and address. The application should access a simple database through a RESTful service. The UI is undefined.

·           Upon completion, check in your code to Github and send the link to HawkSoft.

·           HawkSoft will review your code the following day and will let you know about next steps.
